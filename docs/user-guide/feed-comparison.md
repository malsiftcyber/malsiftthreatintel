# Feed Comparison Analysis

The Feed Comparison Analysis feature provides comprehensive insights into how open source threat intelligence feeds compare with premium paid feeds, helping organizations understand the value and coverage of different feed types.

## Overview

The feed comparison system analyzes the overlap and coverage between:
- **Open Source Feeds**: Free threat intelligence sources

This analysis helps organizations make informed decisions about their threat intelligence strategy and budget allocation.

## Key Metrics

### Coverage Percentages
- **Open Source Coverage**: Percentage of premium indicators also found in open source feeds
- **Premium Coverage**: Percentage of open source indicators also found in premium feeds
- **Overall Overlap**: Percentage of total indicators that appear in both feed types

### Detailed Analysis
- **By Indicator Type**: Comparison breakdown by IP, domain, URL, and hash indicators
- **By Source**: Individual source performance and contribution
- **Trends**: Historical comparison data over time
